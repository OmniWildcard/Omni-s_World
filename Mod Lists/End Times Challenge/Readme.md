![ETC Mod Page Thumbnail](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55b5266a-cbd1-481f-a310-b61dd969459b)

## Requirements
These are the minimum recommended specifications to run the list though there may be some wiggle-room on the GPU:
- 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-11900k CPU or later CPU models
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti or later GPU models (Older NVIDIA GPUs might work but I can't guarantee decent performance)
- 64GB RAM
- 40GB Pagefile

# Introduction
This mod list runs off of the BFCO combat system which mixes modern and vanilla combat rather seamlessly. It was designed with a focus on immersion and overhauling the game in just about every
aspect; all-the-while striking a balance between realism and game-like convenience. xLODGen and DynDOLOD 3 are a requirement for this mod list; so be sure to download them so that you have the
tools to patch the list if you make any additions. Gameplay elements that aren't togglable via an ingame MCM are located under the Modular Gameplay section of the load order and can be toggled
off without issue.

Download the latest version of xLODGen with this link and follow the install instructions:
https://stepmodifications.org/forum/topic/13451-xlodgen-terrain-lod-beta-129-for-fnv-fo3-fo4-fo4vr-tes5-sse-tes5vr-enderal-enderalse/

Download the latest version of DynDOLOD 3 with this link and follow the install instructions:
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68518

All the other tools you'll need are included in the Wabbajack install but may not always be the latest version. If they are ever out-of-date I suggest manually updating them within MO2 to avoid
messing with Skyrim's root directory. This is because Wabbajack installs require a clean Skyrim install to function. If you need help or want me to walk you through the process I'd be glad
to help you on my Discord server. Simply submit a ticket and I'll get to you as soon as possible!

If you wanted to see the list in action you can visit my Twitch channel when I'm live or watch the VODs when they're uploaded to my YouTube channel every Wednesday. I also have a Discord
server where I offer support for the mod list and post updates for when I go live or post videos.

This is to ensure that these take precedence over anything that would be causing issues and so that the world map displays properly.

# Known Issues

2) Weird Giant Frostbite Spider behavior in Bleak Falls Barrow and Ustengrav (Being looked into with the Dungeons Revisited dev)

# FAQS

- Question: My meshes/textures are not rendering properly in-game. What do I do to fix this?
- Answer: This is due to either lacking the Bodyslide Output meshes for it or because it's being overwritten by the ParallaxGen Output. It's recommended to run VRAMr, ParallaxR, ParallaxGen and Bodyslide after adding any new meshes or textures to the install. However, since the process I used to generate the included Bodyslide Output is a bit more intensive, I won't go into detail here but if you submit a ticket on the Discord server I'll walk you through it.

- Question: My NPC's are bald! How do I fix this?
- Answer: This is likely due to me messing up a patch somewhere. Submit a ticket on the Discord server reporting exactly which NPC it was and I'll look into fixing it.

- Question: Where do I go if I'm having issues or want to report a bug?
- Answer: Go to my discord and submit a ticket. I'll look into fixing whatever issues you're having or whatever bug you reported.

- Question: I added a mod to the list and now I'm getting constant CTD's. What do I do?
- Answer: Sadly if you modify the list yourself what support I can offer is extremely limited, especially if it's a hard-incompatibility. But submit a ticket on Discord and if it's something I can help with I'll do what I can to remedy the issue.
