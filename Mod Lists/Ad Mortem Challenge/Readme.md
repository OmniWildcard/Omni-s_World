# Introduction
This mod list runs off of the BFCO combat system which mixes modern and vanilla combat rather seamlessly. It was designed with a focus on immersion and overhauling the game in just about every
aspect; all-the-while striking a balance between realism and game-like convenience. xLODGen and DynDOLOD 3 are a requirement for this mod list; so be sure to download them so that you have the
tools to patch the list if you make any additions. Gameplay elements that aren't togglable via an ingame MCM are located under the Modular Gameplay section of the load order and can be toggled
off without issue.

Download the latest version of xLODGen with the link below and follow the install instructions:
- https://stepmodifications.org/forum/topic/13451-xlodgen-terrain-lod-beta-129-for-fnv-fo3-fo4-fo4vr-tes5-sse-tes5vr-enderal-enderalse/

Download the latest version of DynDOLOD 3 with the link below and follow the install instructions:
- https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68518

All the other tools you'll need are included in the Wabbajack install but may not always be the latest version. If they are ever out-of-date I suggest manually updating them within MO2 to avoid
messing with Skyrim's root directory. This is because Wabbajack installs require a clean Skyrim install to function. If you need help or want me to walk you through the process I'd be glad
to help you on my Discord server. Simply submit a ticket and I'll get to you as soon as possible!

If you wanted to see the list in action you can visit my YouTube channel and watch the episodic series covering the challenge run this mod list is named after. I also have a Discord server where
I offer support for the mod list and post updates for when I go live or post videos.

## What's the Challenge for this List?
I'm glad you asked, because there are some things you should know before playing this list for the first time. First-off, however, if you want to forego the challenge elements you can disable them in your mod list via *Mod Organizer 2* by un-ticking the box next to the associated mods located under the **Modular Gameplay** section.

The challenge of this list comes from the mod, which the list and challenge run series were named after, [Ad Mortem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130582). Ad Mortem adds functional permadeath to the base game of Skyrim. It manages this by making it so that when you perish all your save files for that character, with the exception of saves created within the first five real-world minutes, are deleted and an epitaph with your statistics for that run is recorded in a text file. As such, in keeping with the darker themes of this list, the popular quest mods **Darkend** and **VIGILANT** are included. With that said, go on, let's see how far you can get without dying in the unforgiving world this mod list creates!

# FAQs
- **Question:** I use all of the AE DLC and I'm getting CTDs. How do I fix this?
	- **Answer:** This list was never built with the intent of having all of the AE DLC active at once so I can't fully support any issues caused by it. Personally I suggest you use the *Anniversary Edition Content Picker* to circumvent the issue. If you need help going through this process submit a ticket and I'll walk you through it. If you absolutely must have **ALL** the AE DLC active in this list know that support will be limited as it's outside the scope of my list's intended design.

- **Question:** My meshes/textures are not rendering properly in-game. What do I do to fix this?
	- **Answer:** This is due to either lacking the Bodyslide Output meshes for it or because it's being overwritten by the ParallaxGen Output. It's recommended to run VRAMr, ParallaxR, ParallaxGen and Bodyslide after adding any new meshes or textures to the install. However, since the process I used to generate the included Bodyslide Output is a bit more intensive, I won't go into detail here but if you submit a ticket on the Discord server I'll walk you through it.

- **Question:** My NPC's are bald! How do I fix this?
	- **Answer:** This is likely due to me messing up a patch somewhere. Submit a ticket on the Discord server reporting exactly which NPC it was and I'll look into fixing it.

- **Question:** Where do I go if I'm having issues or want to report a bug?
	- **Answer:** Go to my Discord and submit a ticket. I'll look into fixing whatever issues you're having or whatever bug you reported.

- **Question:** I added a mod to the list and now I'm getting constant CTD's. What do I do?
	- **Answer:** Sadly if you modify the list yourself what support I can offer is extremely limited, especially if it's a hard-incompatibility. But submit a ticket on Discord and if it's something I can help with I'll do what I can to remedy the issue.
