# Welcome to My World!
This is a repository containing all of my mod lists that are part of the overarching collection I like to call Omni's World!
![Omni's World - A Comprehensive Mod List Series](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae4940c0-8ec5-4cac-97ea-09cc5c4f6202)
At present this collection encompasses my Chaos Mage Randomized Challenge, Ad Mortem Challenge and End Times Challenge mod lists. However, it will expand as my content expands to new challenge runs. So I expect this collection to grow over time to include new lists!

# About the Mod Lists
All of these mod lists make use of a similar base but have different modular gameplay elements added in. Sadly, due to various constraints, there are some mods that are not included in any of the Wabbajack install files for them that are required for the full list. These will need to be downloaded and installed manually. You can find download links for those mods below:

Also, it should be noted, the lists are designed to be highly customizable in some areas as I've left certain aspects entirely untouched to maximize compatibility. Want to use a Vampire or Werewolf overhaul of your choice? That's entirely possible with any of my mod lists as none of them include one. Want to add Wintersun to the list? Go right ahead, though you will need to download the Wintersun patches for Daedric Shrines AIO to make the new Daedric Shrines function. These lists serve more as a foundation and a way to replicate my own challenge runs if you wish to give them a try yourself. So go ahead and check them out! I'm sure you'll find one to your liking.

## Skyrim SE/AE
- [End Times Challenge](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/tree/main/Mod%20Lists/End%20Times%20Challenge/Readme.md) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that was featured in the eponymous challenge series on YouTube and Twitch by the list's author. The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. Race against the clock to try and defeat Alduin and Harkon within 100 days or perish with the rest of the world as the apocalypse comes to fruition!

- [Chaos Mage Randomized Challenge](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/tree/main/Mod%20Lists/Chaos%20Mage%20Randomized%20Challenge/Readme.md) (Currently Unreleased) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that was featured in the eponymous challenge series on YouTube and Twitch by the list's author. The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. It's very similar to the Ad Mortem Challenge list but with fewer restrictions to be found in the Modular Gameplay section. Limit yourself with several handicaps as you attempt to complete an overarching task!

- [Ad Mortem Challenge](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/tree/main/Mod%20Lists/Ad%20Mortem%20Challenge/Readme.md) (Currently Unreleased) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that was featured in the eponymous challenge series on YouTube and Twitch by the list's author. The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. Features an extensive amount of additional spells and enchantments compared to vanilla Skyrim and the End Times Challenge list. Try to survive while knowing that death is final and every time you perish you must start over!
