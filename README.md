# Welcome to My World!
This is a repository containing all of my mod lists that are part of the overarching collection I like to call Omni's World!

At present this collection encompasses my Chaos Mage Randomized Challenge, Ad Mortem Challenge and End Times Challenge mod lists. However, it will expand as my content expands to new challenge runs. So I expect this collection to grow over time to include new lists!

# About the Mod Lists
All of these mod lists make use of a similar base but have different modular gameplay elements and exclusives. It should be noted, however, that all of them are designed to be highly customizable in some areas as I've left certain aspects entirely untouched to maximize compatibility. Want to use a Vampire or Werewolf overhaul of your choice? That's entirely possible with any of my mod lists as none of them include one. Want to add Wintersun to the list? Go right ahead, though you will need to download the Wintersun patches for Daedric Shrines AIO to make the new Daedric Shrines function. These lists serve more as a foundation and a way to replicate my own challenge runs if you wish to give them a try yourself. So go ahead and check them out! I'm sure you'll find one to your liking.

## Skyrim SE/AE
- [End Times Challenge](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/blob/main/Readme_Files/ETC_Readme.md) (Currently Down for Maintenance) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that was featured in the eponymous challenge series on YouTube and Twitch by the list's author. The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat via the BFCO combat system; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. Race against the clock to try and defeat Alduin and Harkon within 100 days or perish with the rest of the world as the apocalypse comes to fruition!

The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat via the BFCO combat system; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. So venture forth and try to accomplish your overarching goals; all-the-while overcoming the various handicaps you've been burdened with in a world of cold steel and sorcery!

- [Ad Mortem Challenge](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/blob/main/Readme_Files/AMC_Readme.md) (Currently Unreleased) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that was featured in the eponymous challenge series on YouTube and Twitch by the list's author. The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat via the BFCO combat system; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. Bear in mind, however, that Death waits for no one and every step you take could be your last. So don't be reckless, or you'll quickly find how fickle fate can be, as you will be forced to start again from the very beginning every time you perish!
