# Welcome to my World!
This is a repository containing all of my mod lists that are part of the overarching collection I like to call Omni's World!
![Omni's World - A Comprehensive Mod List Series](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae4940c0-8ec5-4cac-97ea-09cc5c4f6202)
At present this collection encompasses my Chaos Mage Randomized Challenge, Ad Mortem Challenge and End Times Challenge mod lists. However, it will expand as my content expands to new challenge runs. So I expect this collection to grow over time to include new lists!

# About the Mod Lists
All of these mod lists make use of a similar base but have different modular gameplay elements added in. Sadly, due to various constraints, there are some mods that are not included in any of the Wabbajack install files for them that are required for the full list. These will need to be downloaded and installed manually. You can find download links for those mods below:

## Skyrim SE/AE
- [End Times Challenge](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/tree/a65bd35e60f0cae2492e7d4524049fe3400bb0ac/Mod%20Lists/End%20Times%20Challenge) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that was featured in the eponymous challenge series on YouTube and Twitch by the list's author. The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience.
