# Welcome to My World!
This is a repository containing all of my mod lists that are part of the overarching collection I like to call Omni's World!

# About the Mod Lists
All of these mod lists make use of a similar foundation but have different modular gameplay elements and exclusives. Every list except Omni's World also has its own challenge you can attempt if you're looking for something to spice up your next Skyrim run. The lists should be able to be safely modified in two specific areas, as I left them largely untouched from vanilla:
- Vampire Gameplay
- Werewolf Gameplay

> [!WARNING]
> If you modify the lists anywhere except in those two specified areas any support you can recieve will be limited and subject to my discretion.

## Skyrim SE/AE
- [End Times Challenge](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/blob/main/Readme_Files/ETC_Readme.md) (Currently Down for Maintenance) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that was featured in the eponymous challenge series on YouTube and Twitch by the list's author. The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat via the BFCO combat system; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. Race against the clock to try and defeat Alduin and Harkon within 100 days or perish with the rest of the world as the apocalypse comes to fruition!

- [Chaos Mage Randomized Challenge](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/blob/main/Readme_Files/CMRC_Readme.md) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that was featured in the eponymous challenge series on YouTube and Twitch by the list's author. The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat via the BFCO combat system; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. So venture forth and try to accomplish your overarching goals; all-the-while overcoming the various handicaps you've been burdened with in a world of cold steel and sorcery!

- [Ad Mortem Challenge](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/blob/main/Readme_Files/AMC_Readme.md) (Currently Unreleased) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that was featured in the eponymous challenge series on YouTube and Twitch by the list's author. The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim's vanilla combat via the BFCO combat system; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. Bear in mind, however, that Death waits for no one and every step you take could be your last. So don't be reckless, or you'll quickly find how fickle fate can be, as you will be forced to start again from the very beginning every time you perish!

- [Omni's World](https://github.com/OmniWildcard/Omni-s_World/blob/main/Readme_Files/OW_Readme.md) (Currently Unreleased) by Omni the Starspawn
  - A mod list that combines all of the others in this collection into one cohesive experience. The ideal choice for those who want to stuff as much content into the world of Skyrim without having to do any of the custom patching themselves. From BFCO's revamped combat system, to devastating magic spells, to teleportation magic and full dlc-sized custom quests; this list has it all. This will be my biggest undertaking to date and I hope you enjoy the fruits of my labor.
