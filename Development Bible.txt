I. Hardware & Performance Tuning

    CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800 XT
        Cooling: Corsair H100i 240mm AIO
        (Top Exhaust)
        PBO/Tuning: PPT: 128W | TDC: 80A | EDC: 125A | PBO Scalar: 1X | Curve Optimizer: -10 (All Cores) | Max Boost: +200MHz
        Logic: Global C-State, CPPC/Preferred Cores, and SAM (Enabled)
		
		NOTES ON CPU: These specific overclocks are meant to boost the single-thread/single-core performance up to par if not slightly better than my previous CPU which was the i9 11900K without suffering from the massive thermal overhead and throttling that it suffered.
		
    Primary GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT
    (16GB) [Slot 1 / Bus 45]
        Role: Primary Rendering & Monitor Output
        Tuning: Max Freq: +200MHz | Voltage: -70mV | VRAM: 2700MHz | Power Limit: +10% | SAM (Enabled)
		
		NOTES ON PRIMARY GPU: This GPU's role never changes though it does handle any rendering tasks that are not specific to Framegen, Video Recording or Streaming during development as part of its default role as the Primary Renderer.
		
    Secondary GPU: Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti
    (12GB) [Slot 2 / Bus 4]
        Role: Dedicated OBS Encoding (NVENC) & Lossless Scaling (LSFG 3x)
        Config: Power Saving (Headless) | Factory Overclock (Gigabyte)
		
		NOTES ON SECONDARY GPU: This GPU, while a powerhouse, was bottlenecking me with it's 12GB VRAM limit. It is now solely devoted to handling the jobs of Video Recording, Framegen and Streaming. As such it doesn't have any specific overclocks beyond factory defaults. When it isn't doing any of those things it's sitting idle in the case.

	Additional External Cooling: Rowenta Silence Extreme on Turbo force-feeding air into the side-panel intake vent for the three front-side intake fans.

II. Project Authority & Partnership (The Rigmor Saga)

    Status: Official Project Partner with Jim (The Mod Author).
    Role: Technical Director, Remaster Lead, and Compatibility Engineer.
    Mandate: Official oversight to enhance visuals/stability (NextGen, Lighting, 4K Upscaling) without contradicting Jim’s vision for Rigmor of Tamriel (RoT).
    Collaborators: Direct support/cameos from Loona (Loona Shadow) and Jess (Rigmor).
    Creative Anchor: Providing the technical drive and enthusiasm to push the series into its "Definitive Edition" state.
	
	Official Rigmor Extensions:

		RoC World Overhaul: Adding unique NPCs, "Pseudo-Radiant AI" quest-driven packages, and functional worldspaces to Cyrodiil.
		RoC Lighting Overhaul: Fixing legacy "black hole" interiors.
		Side Quest Addon: Sanctioned post-story content featuring official voice talent (Jess/Loona).
		Rigmor of NextGen: Full transition to Quixel Megascans and 3D foliage.
		Rose of High Poly: A resculpt of Rose to bring her in line with the High Poly Heads of other mods.

III. Strategic Project Roadmap

    RoC Lighting Overhaul: Modernized hand-placed lighting for legacy interior "black holes."
    RoC World Overhaul: Unique NPCs, "Pseudo-Radiant AI" (Quest-driven package swapping), and functional Inns/Dungeons.
    Rigmor's Saga - Side Quest Addon: Post-story content with official voice talent.
    Rigmor of NextGen: Transition to Quixel Megascan assets, Full 3D foliage, and FOMOD tiers.
    Possible High Rock Expansion: Post-RoT worldspace connection in partnership with a veteran worldspace modder. I will likely be filling in for the weak points of the specific mod author who lacks experience with NPC logic and AI Packages.

IV. Consolidated Build & LOD Logic (Source of Truth) 
	Index Locking Protocol:
		2A Placeholder: DynDOLOD_Placeholder.esm (seated at 2A to prevent index shifting post-generation).
		2A LOD Master: The target seat for the final DynDOLOD.esm output.
		DA Master Patch: Standard .esp (un-esmified) to prevent Mod Organizer 2 from snapping it to 2B.
		FE:0DC: SkyUI (UI Anchor).
		
	The Gauntlet Generation Phase (Drive I):
		Sync Logic: FreeFileSync mirrors C (Dev) + J (Asset Table) -> I (Gauntlet).
		Bake State: All BSAs disabled; tools (SSELODGen, TexGen, DynDOLOD) target Loose Winners.
		Large Reference Fix: Ensure DynDOLOD DLL NG reports "Workaround: Enabled.
		
	Dual-Generation Pass (Drive I):
        Run 1 (Public): Base Eastmarch Terrain Fix (Narzulbur Camp enabled).
        Run 2 (Bruma DC Beta): Eastmarch Terrain Fix - Rigmor Patch (ESPFE) enabled. Restores Narzulbur scene, removes bridge camp, and pushes 11+ patches (WTT, Water for ENB, Northern Roads) down the stack. Requires dedicated TexGen/DynDOLOD output.
    Texture Standard: 4K Hybrid Upscale (Topaz Gigapixel). Sharpened RGB + Softened Alpha to fix "Nuclear Glow" on 2D branch planes. Trunks use direct upscale.	

V. List Philosophy
	This list operates on the philosophy of Morrowind where the path to true power and quintessential godhood is EARNED through mastery of the game's mechanics. To truly master this list you must invest in the Enchanting and Smithing trees and learn to abuse the now unrestricted Enchanting system with the powerful enchantments of Summermyst. This alone will not make the player immortal as there are boss overhauls that provide genuine challenges that REQUIRE this level of power to beat reliably. We utilize a mix of combat mods and gameplay changes to prevent the stat pool bloat of vanilla:
		ESLA: Provides the Oblivion-style leveling and attributes system along with Birthsigns & Classes.
		Valhalla Combat: Adds the Dynamic Parry System and general flow of combat that is needed.
		Wildcat: Makes all fights frantic and fast-paced affairs and provides the injury system. Also stacks carefully with other stamina cost mods on drawing bows and attacking to be fair but still punishing if you swing wildly.
		BFCO + SCAR: Provides the more fluid combat that this kind of system requires.
		True Armor: Provides differences between armors based on materials and locks the vanilla damage reduction scaling to a 25% maximum.
		Biggie Traits: Provides an extra layer of depths to your builds and provides unique perks.
		Subclasses of Skyrim 2: Provides even further depth and specialization for your primary class of choice.
		Ultimate Dodge: Provides the dodge system to compliment the more complex and frantic combat.
		Conditional Stamina Costs - SPID: Makes stamina the lifeblood of your ability to fight and enforces stamina costs to everything involved with combat. Magic spells cost not only magicka but stamina to cast and concentration spells gradually drain your stamina as well as your magicka; showcasing that exerting these magical forces is not only a feat of the mind but of the body and soul.
	
	For Stealth we use a combination of mods that play nice with our ENB choice of Dawnfire ENB for NAT III Weathers:
		RAID (Realistic AI Detection): Removes the heavy weighting of vanilla stealth mechanics to take other factors into account besides your stealth skill level.
		Dynamic Height Adjustment: Makes it so the hitbox bumper matches the model. If you are stealthed and crouched you can fit in tighter spaces than you could while standing and so on.
		Dynamic Weather and Time Based Detection: Makes it so weather and time of day play into the detection mechanics.
		DIAL: Makes dark spaces indoors more Hollywood-dark where you can still see things but the engine will still consider you to have some shadow coverage.
		Book of Shadows: Gives the player more tools and ways to turn this into a tactical experience for stealth gameplay.
	
	We've planned for the future to include Eldritch horror elements in the bubble in time area accessed by the vanilla Wooden Mask. The player will find a retextured black book mesh that is the journal of an Apostate Dragon Priest who delved into magicks even the Dragons considered forbidden. The book will detail a set of three rings that have unique enchantments from the Summermyst Enchantments mod; specifically the Kraken, Titan and Leviathan enchantments that cause your stat pools to feed into each other and bolster each other. This supports the "earned godhood" philosophy that my list follows that calls back to the era of Morrowind's development. This is the text that is on the last page of that book they will find along with ONE of the rings to entice them to search for the rest:
		
		[Page 1]
		(The text before you is clearly written in Dovahzul, the Dragon Tongue, and has been rigidly inked into the pages)
		The High Priests seek eternity through the Thu'um, but they are blind to the architecture beneath the stars. I have found the first of the three pillars that support the weight of Mundus: The Kraken. My peers called it a relic of the deep and the dirt, but it is a constant. It is the Anchor of Breath.
		
		By binding the Kraken’s essence, the soul's density begins to shift. Strength is no longer a static thing; it becomes a percentage of the soul's volume. It bolsters the frame, feeding the lungs of the Titan until the vessel becomes harder than the stone of Bromjunaar. Here, the loop begins: Stamina flows into the blood, transmuting physical exertion into raw vitality.
		
		[Page 2]
		The second pillar is The Leviathan, the Crucible of Flesh. If the Kraken is the breath, the Leviathan is the tenacity of the vessel. It does not merely sustain life; it converts the very heat of the blood into Aetherial potential.
		
		I have seen beyond the half-truths that our eyes tell us and peered into the foundations of the Forge itself. Through this ring, the "Health" of the mortal coil is harvested to fuel the mind. The flesh feeds the Magicka, creating a reservoir of power that draws directly from the user's own physical endurance. The lines of our fathers' tongue—the rigid Dovahzul—struggle to contain this truth. The geometry is shifting.

		[Page 3]
		(The writing begins to slant and the once rigidly-inked symbols begin to take on a shaky appearance)
		The final pillar is The Titan, the Beacon of the Void. It is the closing of the circuit. When the essence of the Kraken and the Leviathan are unified with the Titan, the pools are no longer separate basins, but a single, rushing ocean of divinity.
		
		It is a recursive loop—a serpent eating its own tail. The mind’s Magicka returns to bolster the body’s Stamina, completing the Trinity. By binding the Kraken’s breath to the Titan’s mind, I am rewriting the physics of my own blood. I have become a variable that the Great Weaver, Akatosh, did not account for. I have found the key to bypass the limitations of the Forge... but the words... they are failing me...
		
		[Page 4]
		(There is a sudden shift in the texts from the rigid tongue of Dovah to erratic Glyphs you do not recognize. As you stare at the page trying to make sense of it the words seem to warp and change shape until they become something you can recognize as Cyrodilic. You question if your mind is unraveling at the seams or if this is merely an illusion.)
		The endurance of a Titan, the raw power of a Kraken, and the tenacity of a Leviathan; does this power know no limits? It feels wrong, yet I am urged onwards by an invisible hand. I thought this Wooden Mask offered sanctuary, but the silence of this mask is a lie.
		
		Even here, in the dead-zones where time has no jurisdiction, I feel a weight behind my eyes—a great, lidless hunger. It does not stop me; it watches. It wants to see if the loop will hold, or if the friction of my ascension will set the Aurbis aflame. The lines of the Dragon tongue no longer fit the truth I see. I am no longer a priest of the Cult; I am a scribe writing a chapter for a Librarian I never served. May my masters forgive my insolence as the void finally takes me.

	When they leave the bubble and remove the mask with the book and ring in tow there will be a slight delay to allow the weather effects and normal audio to resume. During this delay there will be subtitles that appear if the player has them on that read:
	"The silence stays with me. Even with the mask off, I can hear the Librarian turning the pages of my thoughts."
	After this text fades there will be a Mora Rumble as if to signify that you've brought something back with you that doesn't belong here; something so powerful it acts like a glitch in the matrix that even Hermaeus Mora can not help but notice.
	
	There is also a litmus test that sets the tone for what the player should expect and sets them up to explore every nook and cranny; assuming they don't rush through the tutorial zone of Alternate Perspective. I have, admittedly, spoiled the existence of some of these secrets for the streamers who are early adopters of the list so that their viewers get to see the best parts of the list when they showcase the next update.
	
	On the second floor of the inn in Helgen is a book, key and a chest that the key unlocks sitting next to the table by the windows. If the player opens the chest it contains armor left behind by a retired adventurer who also left behind the key to the chest that was placed on top of the note on the table. In the note he laments the charged climate of Skyrim and mentions that it's only a matter of time before tensions reach a boiling point (foreshadowing the start of the civil war) and the note is dated in the 4th Era exactly one year before the start of the civil war in Skyrim. He also says in the note that if his old gear can be of use to you your welcome to it and wishes you luck in your adventures. This adventurer used to live in the second floor rooms and shared the space with the previous owners of the inn (likely the parents of the current owners). Why the offspring never saw fit to open the chest or sell off the gear is not explained but it's implied they had no aspirations to be adventurers and so left the chest and its contents to gather dust in their rooms.
	
	This gear is high-tier end-game gear that can carry them all the way to the end of the game if they so choose. The armor is glass-tier and comes with a one-handed sword named Mythras which is daedric-tier. There are various such custom sets sprinkled throughout the game, hidden in obscure and often unexplored areas of the map; much like the powerful enchantments that help the player break free and gain their "earned godhood" which are often tucked away in similar locales.

VI. Optimization & Shipping:
	Binary Matching: Wabbajack hashes loose winners vs. 145GB Master Asset Table (BSAs) for deduplication.
	Fat-Trimming Script: PowerShell-driven RUN THIS AFTER INSTALL! script purges loose textures post-install to enforce BSA engine-load dominance.
	Master Copy Tier (Default Shipping State): Native 8K/4K Mountains and Native 4K General Sweep.
			
		NOTES ON MASTER COPY TIER: Clutter and small objects with a small handfull of shell textures are 2K or 1K depending on what the author shipped them with. These textures have been left untouched by upscaling.
			
	Octagon Scaling Tiers:
		8GB Standard: 4K Hero Diffuse / 1K Hero Maps / 2K Diffuse:1K Maps General Sweep.
		8GB High Performance: Universal 2K Diffuse / 1K Maps, Parallax and Complex Material.
		12GB Tier: 4K Hero Diffuse / 2K General Sweep.
		Hard Exclusions: They cover all LOD resources and high risk map suffixes except for _p, _parallax and _m. The only things they let through are diffuse textures, normal maps and those few maps I previously mentioned.
			
VII. V1.5.0.0 Maintenance Pivot
    Status: Skyrim worldspace enters "Maintenance/Bug-fix only" state with a few caveats:
		- Gameplay Mechanics may still be tweaked, removed or outright replaced in `PATCH` or `REVISION` updates if I feel they are overcomplicating the list or making the user experience worse.
		- Visual upgrades may still occur via `MINOR` updates as I haven't decided if I'm fully satisfied with the smaller villages and towns that I currently have left untouched (ie. Rorikstead, Karthwasten, etc.)
	
	Primary focus shifts to Cyrodiil once I'm satisfied and ready to move to v1.5.0.0 and beyond.
	
    Optimization: Engine-level frame caps for Havok/Script stability.
    Modular Gameplay: Unlocked tail-end load order for user customization without breaking Index Locking.
	
VIII. The Apostate’s Tale & The Temporal Anomalies
	Narrative Foundation: The Theft of Linear Time
		The Apostate’s Tale serves as the primary narrative gateway to "Earned Godhood." It centers on a rogue Dragon Priest who discovered that the recursive power of the Trinity Rings—the Kraken, Leviathan, and Titan—generated such extreme metaphysical friction that it physically rent their locations from the Grip of Akatosh. These "Time Bubbles" are not merely magical sanctuaries; they are Wounds in the Aurbis, pockets of non-linear reality where the Dragon God of Time has lost his jurisdiction.
		
	Quest Persistence: Once the player triggers the unmarked quest in Labyrinthian, both the Wooden Mask and the Apostate's Journal are flagged as Quest Items to prevent accidental loss during the hunt.
	
	The Sovereign Skeleton Key: The Wooden Mask
		In v1.5, the Wooden Mask is elevated from a one-off gimmick to a Sovereign Skeleton Key. It is the only anchor dense enough to allow a mortal to transition into these Akatosh-free zones. While Labyrinthian remains the primary gateway, the Apostate has hidden two additional anomalies in places of concentrated Dragon Cult power (e.g., Forelhost and Skuldafn), each housing a singular piece of the Trinity.
	
	The Librarian’s Interest: The Mora Rumble
		Hermaeus Mora acts as a Metaphysical Geiger Counter throughout this quest. His inaction is a form of predatory curiosity; these bubbles are "dark spots" in the Elder Scrolls that he cannot otherwise see.
			- The Anticipation: As the player nears an anomaly, a low-frequency rumble and screen-shake peak, signaling Mora is "holding his breath" in anticipation of a mortal attempting to claim a forbidden variable.
			- The Receipt: Upon claiming a ring, the rumble serves as Mora "signing the ledger"—acknowledging the entry of a new, unrecorded variable into the world.
			
	The Trinity Mechanics: Breaking the Matrix
		The artifacts are purged from standard Summermyst loot tables and transformed into Singular Relics. When unified, they create a recursive loop that allows stat pools to feed into one another exponentially:
			- The Kraken (Stamina): The Anchor of Breath. Buffs your Health by a percentage of your Stamina.
			- The Leviathan (Health): The Crucible of Flesh. Buffs your Magicka by a percentage of your Health.
			- The Titan (Magicka): The Beacon of the Void. Buffs your Magicka by a percentage of your Stamina.
	
	The "Apostate's Path" Geometry
		Each "Time Bubble" now acts as a Metaphysical Anchor for one of the Trinity Rings:
			- Bubble 1 - Labyrinthian (The Anchor of Breath): The classic Bromjunaar sanctuary. This remains the gateway where the player finds the Apostate's Manifesto and the first ring.
			- Bubble 2 - Forelhost (The Crucible of Flesh): A high-altitude seat of power where the Dragon Cult concentrated their most "physical" rituals. This is where the Leviathan ring is hidden, shielded by the echoes of a lost era.
			- Bubble 3 - High Hrothgar (The Beacon of the Void): A place of extreme "verticality" and closeness to the Aetherial currents. This houses the Titan ring, the final "glitch" needed for the recursive stat loop.
	
	The "Mora Rumble" Integration
	As the player traverses these bubbles, the Hermaeus Mora audio cue will increase in intensity and layering.
		- Bubble 1: A faint, curious vibration.
		- Bubble 2: A deeper, resonant "hum" that shakes the screen.
		- Bubble 3: The full, unbridled Mora Rumble as he realizes you aren't just a seeker of knowledge—you're a seeker of Ascension and are risking the stability of the Aurbis to achieve it. The Daedric Prince is both intrigued and impressed by your determination in the face of potential annihilation. 
	
	Flavor Text
	- Kraken: The Anchor of Breath
	"The lungs of the deep bolster the frame. Strength is no longer static; it is a density born of exertion."
	- Leviathan: The Crucible of Flesh
	"The heat of the blood is harvested. The tenacity of the vessel provides the fuel for the mind's eye."
	- Titan: The Beacon of the Void
	"The circuit closes. The mind's fire returns to the limbs, and the serpent finally consumes its own tail."
	
IX. Lore & Etymology of Aracano and Ceyndu.
	Ayleid Ruin Name: Aracano 
	The name is comprised of a combination of Arcan ("Magic" in the Ayleid language) and Cano ("Dungeon" or "prison" in the Ayleid language). This name implies "imprisoning magic" or a "magical trap," which is a form of illusion. It hints at the nature of this ruin serving more as a prison meant to keep something sealed away.
	
	Ayleid Lich Name: Ceyndu the Deceiver
	This name combines the Ayleid word for "shadow" (Cey) with a suffix, giving it a name-like quality. It is meant to refer to someone or something that is "of the shadows". In my mind this is perfect for a fallen Ayleid Lord or Sorcerer-King who was overthrown and sealed away for his crimes.
	
X. Ceyndu the Deceiver Boss Encounter
	Character and Design Philosophy Overview:
		- Character Identity: Ceyndu the Deceiver, an ancient Ayleid Lich and endgame-tier challenge (Post-Rigmor of Cyrodiil / Main Story).
		- Encounter Philosophy: A transition from "Arrogant Play" (Managed Waves) to "Unrestrained Lethality" (Stacking Waves).
		- Follower Management: Uses a Persistent Cloak Spell (Pulse-check for IsPlayerTeammate) during all scripted scenes (Intro & Mid-Fight Transition).
		- Follower Balancing: To prevent followers from being permanently sidelined in "Bleedout" during Phase 2, a hidden damage-scaling pass is applied during the introductory scene. Clones maintain 100% lethality against the player but utilize a modified damage curve against NPCs to ensure the "Hero's Party" remains functional as a distraction throughout the 10+ clone stacking phase.
		- Behavior: Forces all followers to StopCombat(), StopCombatAlarm(), and sets Aggression to 0.
		- The Hand-off: Cloak is dispelled at the climax of the monologue. Because the Magic Effect has the "Recover" flag, all follower AI and aggression levels snap back to default instantly as combat resumes.
		- Party Synergy: This system allows the player to bring Loona, Rigmor, and any additional followers without breaking the scripted drama or balance of the encounter.
		- Stagger Resistance: Possesses nearly infinite Stamina Offset, making him immune to standard physical/magical staggering.
		- The Shout Threshold: While Ceyndu is immune to mundane staggering, he is hard-coded to stagger when hit by the third word of Unrelenting Force (Dah). This ensures that any player who has completed the Dragon Child DLC has the necessary tool to break his True Invisibility and create a damage window, regardless of their level.
		- Progression-Locked Challenge: Tuned specifically for a post-Main Story/Rigmor-campaign character who has mastered their Thu'um.
	
	Introductory Scene
		- Visuals & Staging: As the player enters the scene trigger in the center of the room at the base of the stairs to the throne, the doors magically seal. Ceyndu delivers his initial speech while descending the stairs as clones spawn sequentially in a curved fan-line on his left and right flanks, ensuring full visibility in 1st/3rd person. He stops at the base of the stairs to stand before the player who is currently locked in place with controls disabled before delivering his final line of the monologue to trigger the start of the fight.

    Phase 1: The Deceiver's Game
		- Audio: Phase 1 Theme — Heavy, rhythmic industrial stomp.
		- Mechanics:
			- Core Trick: Utilizes the fake-out move (standard invisibility + decoy) infrequently.
			- Reinforcements & AI: Any clone waves spawned during this phase (after the intro) appear instantaneously. These serve as "Managed Waves" with logic that prevents a second wave from spawning until the first is cleared and spawn in a locked pentagram formation (5 clones as opposed to the 6 from the intro) that is spread out to prevent the player easily kiting them and the boss around the room. Their AI and the Boss's AI allow full freedom to float away from the player using the Dragon Priest AI as a base.
		- Narrative Tone: Composed and condescending; he treats the player as an insignificant threat and is clearly toying with them.
	
	The Mid-Fight Transition (Health Threshold: 25-50%)
		- Scene: Combat freezes; clones dispel; player controls disabled.
		- Dialogue: Ceyndu acknowledges the player as a "worthy foe" and declares they will now "bend and submit" before his unbridled magicks.
		- The Shift: He drops all restraint, moving from a playful duel to a frantic execution.
	
	Phase 2: Unrestrained Chaos
		- Audio: Phase 2 Theme — Chaotic, frantic, and psychological.
		- Mechanics:
			- True Invisibility: Swaps to a custom spell with no visual shimmer for both his standard combat strategy and his use of fake-outs. He will only drop invisibility to attack or spawn new waves of clones but will grant a few seconds of a window where he doesn't resume invisibility. He will more frequently fake out the player than in phase 1.
			- Tactical Counterplay: Detectable via Detect Dead (Magic) or by tracking projectile origins/staggering during attack frames (Martial).
			- No Invincibility: He remains physically present while invisible. Stray Shouts, AoE spells, or lucky swings will stagger him and temporarily break his concealment.
			- Stacking Waves: Wave-limit logic is disabled. Clones spawn instantaneously and can stack to 10+ if not managed.
		- Vocal Direction: Voiced by creator. Tone shifts to a manic, strained power-surge with heavy ethereal and pitch-shifted effects.
		
XI. The Dialogue of Ceyndu
	Introductory Scene (The Descent)

		CEYNDU: (Ayleid resonance/Deep Reverb) "The doors rattle... the dust of an era stirs. Tell me, mortal... did you come seeking the treasures of a fallen age, or are you merely another soul lost in the shadow of Aracano?"
		(Clone 1 & 2 Ignites)
		CEYNDU: "You carry the scent of the surface. A 'Dragonborn.' A 'Champion.' Titles meant to mask the fragility of your era. You stand in the prison of a King... and you have forgotten why the King was feared."
		(Clones 3 & 4 Ignite)
		RIGMOR: (Tense) "Loona, stay close. Everything about this guy gives me a bad feeling... he's talking like he owns the very air we're breathing."
		LOONA: "He did own it once, Rigmor. Be ready. He’s not just talking... he's multiplying. Look to his flanks!"
		(Final Clones Ignite - Fan Formation Complete)
		CEYNDU: (Voice drops to a predatory whisper) "I am Ceyndu. And the shadows... have been hungry for a very long time."
		(Phase 1 Music Triggers)
	
	The Mid-Fight Transition Scene	
		Triggered at 25-50% Health. Combat freezes, clones dispel, and the "Cloak" perk applies to followers.
			CEYNDU: (A sharp, pained intake of breath—half-laugh, half-growl) A 'worthy foe' at last! You strike with the heat of a dying sun... but you have only seen the veil I chose to wear.
			CEYNDU: (The voice begins to distort, layering with a deeper, monstrous resonance) Did you think a few trinkets and a title made you my equal? I am the shadow that outlasted your gods!
			CEYNDU: (Heavy Ethereal/Reverse Reverb effects peak here—vocalize this with an unrestrained, manic power) Witness the unbridled weight of a King unrestrained! Fall... bend... and SUBMIT!
	
	Phase 2: Combat Barks
		Since he is now "True Invisible" and kiting the player using Dragon Priest AI, these lines should trigger randomly during his "Reveal Windows" or when he spawns a fresh Stacking Wave.
			- On Wave Spawn: My shadows are endless! How many can you strike down before your heart fails?
			- On Fake-Out (Decoy Trigger): You chase a ghost, mortal! I am everywhere... and I am nowhere.
			- During Invisibility (Directional Audio): Can you feel the chill running up and down your spine? It is the very magicks of Aracano tightening their grip, closing around your throat!
			- On Stagger (When hit while veiled): (Snarling) A lucky strike! It will be your last!
			
	Death Quote:
	And so... it ends... in silence.

	The Watcher Quote:
	"Finally... the stars align. The shadow waits for you... in Aracano."
	
	The Watcher Event: Narrative & Technical Logic
		The Prerequisites: Completion of Rigmor of Cyrodiil (RoC) and the Dragonchild DLC. This ensures the player has the "soul density" Ceyndu is searching for.
		The Trigger: Exploring the Cyrodiil worldspace with Rigmor. Her "being watched" dialogue acts as the auditory cue for the player to use Detect Dead.
		The Revelation: Upon casting, the visage of Ceyndu is revealed observing the party.
		The Transition: A scripted cut-to-black followed by the Watcher Quote ("Finally... the stars align. The shadow waits for you... in Aracano.").
		The Return: A fade-back into the worldspace with Rigmor’s follow-up dialogue ("You look like you've seen a ghost. Are you alright?"), grounding the event as a shared, yet deeply personal, metaphysical summons.

XII. The Lore of Aracano and the Subverted Seal
    The Ruin: Aracano ("Imprisoning Magic"). An ancient Ayleid lbriary and hall of learning, once known as Silaseli, that was hastily converted into a high-security vault to contain Ceyndu. His peers were so desperate to seal him before their binding spells failed that they repurposed existing architecture rather than building a new prison from scratch.
	The Predatory Subversion: Ceyndu utilized the prison’s own surveillance magicks to observe the archeological team. He identified the most "influenceable" member and, using True Invisibility, whispered a false bargain of "lost knowledge" to lure them into the depths.
	The Controlled Descent: Ceyndu acted as an "Invisible Hand" from within his throne room using the magicks of Aracano, resetting every puzzle, door, and seal behind the researcher as they moved forward. This forced the researcher to solve the way into the throne room while making it impossible to go back.
	The Experiment: The researcher was never meant to be a partner; only a test subject. Ceyndu has been "storing" him, using the ruin's ancient power reserves as a battery for the Stacking Waves and True Invisibility he unleashes on the player in Phase 2.

XIII. The Shifting Labyrinth of Aracano (Floor B1-B2)
	Lore Identity: Originally a grand hall of learning, the architecture now serves as a dynamic gauntlet. Ceyndu has subverted the prison's logic, turning the security measures into his personal "Spider's Web."
	The Labyrinth (Orange Blocks): A dynamic gauntlet where Ceyndu has manually subverted the prison's logic. He uses these shifting walls to disorient and separate the party, turning the architectural security into his personal "Spider's Web."
	The Researcher’s Camp: Located near the western B2 entrance. It contains the Final Journal, which seeds the narrative for the descent:
		- The Mystery: Describes the researcher’s growing paranoia as the "living walls" began to reset behind him.
		- The Whisper: Mentions a voice—the "Shadow-King"—promising "untold and long-lost magical knowledge" in exchange for the researcher’s assistance in dismantling the final seals.
		- The Realization: Notes the discovery that Aracano was once a different place, repurposed in a feverish panic by kings who feared Ceyndu's mastery over the essence of Mundus.
	Mechanical Hubs:
		- Green Buttons & Red Engraving: Activator buttons situated near an ancient riddle plaque. Solving the riddle allows the player to manipulate the orange walls to navigate the maze.
		- Purple/Lavender Zones: Illusionary floor puzzles that require the Encoded Map (found in a nearby container) to navigate safely.
		- The Cell (Beige): Positioned at the southern-most point of B2. The researcher is imprisoned here, serving as the final "bait" to lure the player into the B2 Throne Room.
	The Shadow's Bypass (The Loopback): A secret egress in the western wing leading back to 1F. Originally carved by Ceyndu to study his captors, it now serves as his intended invasion corridor to the surface. It bypasses the main camp, exiting behind the archeological team.
		
XIV. The Spoils of Silaseli: Boss-Specific Master Spells
	These pull from a randomized leveled list, granting the player one per successful run.
		Ceyndu’s Divergence (Illusion)
			- The Mechanic: Upon casting, the player’s current physical form is "locked" in place as a tangible shadow-clone decoy. Simultaneously, the player’s true essence is thrust into a state of True Invisibility (no shimmer) and brief Invulnerability (SetGhost).
			- The Utility: A perfect "panic button" for Wildcat combat. It forces the AI to target the stationary husk while the player repositions for a surgical counter-strike.
		
		The Shadow-King’s Projection (Master Illusion/Utility)
			- The Mechanic: The player’s consciousness is transferred into a mobile Shadow Clone. While in this "Astral" state, the player gains full control of the clone to scout, trigger traps, or harass enemies.
			- The Guard: The player’s original body remains at the point of origin, granted True Invisibility and Invincibility. The effect ends if the clone is destroyed or the cast is canceled.
			- The Utility: The ultimate tool for the DIAL "Hollywood-Dark" dungeons and much more.
		
		Silaseli’s Resentment (Concentration Destruction)
			- The Mechanic: A continuous beam of concentrated Ayleid star-light laced with shadow energy. It draws heavily from the player's Leviathan/Kraken pools.
			- The Effect: Deals untyped Essence Damage (ie. True Damage) that ignores standard resistances. Targets hit by the beam suffer the "Weight of Eras"—a stacking movement and attack speed debuff (10% per second)
			- The Climax: Should a target’s speed reach 0%, they suffer a "Geometric Snap," triggering a massive physical explosion as the environment itself crushes the "imprisoned" victim.

XV. Ceyndu's Journal

	[Page 1]
	The others—my 'peers,' the petty Kings of the Hegemony—build their thrones on the backs of slaves and the sting of the lash. They are small men. They crave the scream, the scent of burning flesh, the crude theatre of cruelty to remind themselves of their own height. I found such methods... inefficient.
	
	A slave who fears the whip still dreams of the day it breaks. A subject who obeys out of terror is a variable I could not tolerate. In my kingdom, I did not need the lash. I needed only the Will. I wove the logic of Silaseli so tightly around my people that my whims became their only truth. I did not break their bodies; I rewrote the natural order of their minds until my command was as inevitable as the sunrise. My peers look to Magnus for their dawn; my people looked only to me. They did not serve me because they were afraid. They served me because they could not conceive of a world where I was not the center.
	
	[Page 2]
	It was this 'Efficiency' that finally broke the Hegemony’s nerves. They watched as my borders expanded without a single drop of blood spilled in rebellion. They watched as my subjects walked into the fires of my forges not because I ordered it, but because they believed the heat was the path to my favor. I had refined the starlight within Silaseli until it was no longer a gift from Aetherius, but a leash.
	
	The Kings of the South and the West united. Not out of justice, but out of the sheer, shivering realization that my mastery over the magicks of Mundus was beginning to render their crude empires obsolete. They brought the wrath of the entire Hegemony to my gates—ten thousand sorcerers, a hundred Daedric pacts signed in desperate blood. They brought a hurricane of noise to drown out my silence. They did not come to liberate my people. They came to extinguish a reality they could no longer understand.
	
	[Page 3]
	Even then, they could not kill me. The geometry of my soul was already too deeply rooted in the architecture of the stars. I fought them with the very air they breathed, turning their own lungs into cages of ice and their thoughts into labyrinths of glass. I built Silaseli to be the needle that threads the Wheel, the single perfect point upon which Mundus would turn. But even a God-King can be exhausted by the sheer volume of mediocrity.
	
	They brought me down not by skill, but by the weight of a thousand trembling hands. They could not destroy the 'Shadow-King,' so they did the only thing cowards know how to do: they built a box. A crude metaphor, a sick joke, designed purely to contain something they refused to comprehend; the will of a god!
	
	[Page 4]
	The sounds of the masons have stopped. In their place is a rhythmic, frantic chanting—a desperate weaving of Ayleidoon wards I haven't heard since the era's dawn. They are clearing the library shelves not to save the scrolls, but to make room for the Welkynd-clusters. Silaseli, my hall of star-gazers, is being choked by the architecture of a cage. They call it 'Aracano' now. A prison for 'imprisoning magic.' They think a name change will change the truth: I am not the prisoner. I am the reason this world needs a cage.
	
	I just sensed the final seals being set. I've felt the snap of the Merethic Era close around my throat; but my peers were sloppy. In their haste to bury me, they left much of my own enchantments and magical surveillance intact but turned it into a weapon they may use against me. It is ironic, but this setback will not abate my ambitions and I have nothing but time.
	
	[Page 5]
	They think they have 'locked' the palace, but they have only synchronized it to my heartbeat. Every ward they etched into the stone in their feverish panic is powered by the very essence they tried to suppress. I can feel the 'Labyrinth' taking shape; the shifting blocks of the lower halls groaning as the logic of my home is subverted into a spider's web. They call it Aracano now—a name that tastes of copper and cowardice.
	
	They work in the halls above, their hands shaking as they pile stone upon stone to hide the entrance. They believe that by burying the door, they bury the King. Fools. My Divergence is already reaching past these walls. While my flesh rots upon this throne, my sight drifts through the shifting geometry of the world they think they've saved. I see the constellations shifting; the stars themselves are not as fixed as my brothers believe.
	
	[Page 6]
	I will watch their starlight fade. I will witness the rise of the short-lived races and the eventual decay of the very wards that bind me. And when the time is right, I will find a "Champion"—one with a soul dense enough to weather the storm—and I will lure them into this 'forsaken' tomb to dismantle the final seals that have thusfar prevented me from bending the magicks of Aracano fully to my will. They will come seeking 'lost knowledge,' but they will only find the architect of their undoing and the end of an age.
	
	Let them have their era. I shall have the next.
	
	[Page 7]
	I have watched the flickering candles of this new era from my silence. They trade their gods for a stay of execution and call it 'diplomacy.' These Medes are not Kings; they are merely the last few embers of a fire that forgot it was meant to burn. They build their 'huts' from the rubble of my ancestors' White-Gold, squatting in a Tower they no longer have the Will to stabilize. They watch the spokes of the Wheel snap one by one and mistake the sound of the collapse for the march of progress.
	
	And then there are the hooded fools in the south—the 'Aldmeri.' They dream of a divinity found in the unmaking, thinking to ascend by drowning the world in the chaos of a broken Calpa. They are vandals, not architects. They would rather see Mundus dissolve into a messy, uncertain void than master the Geometric Certainty required to hold it. I have no desire to perish in their loud, clumsy apocalypse. I will not be 'undone' by the whims of children playing with matches.
	
	I have waited eons for something else. A Rising Sun that does not seek to break the Tower, but to claim it. A Champion who understands that true Silence is not the absence of sound, but the perfection of Order.
	
	Perhaps, very soon, the stars will finally align. My shadow awaits... in Aracano.
	
XVI. The Tragedy of Ceyndu
	"Inconvenient Truth" of Ayleid Society:
		- He wasn't hated for his cruelty but for his competence. Even the most "benign" Ayleid kings couldn't stomach the mirror he held up to their culture—that their power was just a messy, loud imitation of the absolute control he had already perfected.
		- They brought noise to his silence, they all united to take down something they refused to understand or accept; someone who had perfected that which they all sought to achieve, the complete subjugation of the short-lived races. Instead of celebrating his accomplishment his efficiency engendered fear that he would one day topple his own peers and take their power from them. The irony is heavy in that had this happened it would've been the perfect vision of Ayleid supremacy that they all claimed to seek. An entire region consolidated under one absolute and stable rule at the heel of an Ayleid Sorcerer-King.
		- His death in silence isn't just his end; it’s the end of that specific, pure Ayleid vision that the rest of the Hegemony was too "mediocre" to maintain. It's the end of a mer who reached the heights of power amongst the Hegemony only to be betrayed by his own kind and sealed away, not out of fear or hatred of his methods, but because they worked all too well. Had he been born into another era and been anything but an Ayleid ruler he might've chosen a different path, he might've become one of the great rulers of his era noted for bringing order to the typical chaos that surrounds mortals. Instead he was cast down by a race that couldn't stand to look itself in the mirror he put in front of them.
	
	Shorthand Summary:	
		The Competence Paradox: He was hated not for his cruelty, but for his absolute efficiency. He achieved the Ayleid dream of total subjugation without the "messy" noise of fear, which terrified his peers.
		The Hegemony's Betrayal: The kings of his era claimed to seek Ayleid supremacy, yet they united to destroy the only mer who actually perfected it. They feared his stability and the possibility of his rule toppling their own "mediocre" empires.
		The Final Silence: His end signals the death of a vision that could have brought order to the chaos of mortals, had it not been born from the poisoned soil of Ayleid culture. He was a monster crafted by monsters who couldn't stand the reflection he provided.
		
XVII. The Existential Exhaustion
	The Merethic Fatigue: After eons of observing the "endless dance" of empires, Ceyndu has developed a profound existential exhaustion. He no longer wishes to rule or even to watch; he craves the unknown of what lies beyond.
	
	The "Silence" as Release: His desire for Silence is a desire for the cessation of the "noise" of history. He seeks a "dark act of mercy" from the player to finally allow him to move on to whatever afterlife or void awaits him.
	
	The Trial of the Worthy: If the player fails, they are simply another "mediocre" variable. If they succeed, they are the key to his release. He desires this "rattling of the coils" above all else, seeking a finality that the Merethic wards denied him.
	
XVIII. The Black Box of Immortality
	The Beacon that Never Was: The fact that, were Ceyndu not born to the Ayleids but instead to the kingdoms of Man, he might've ended up as another great ruler the likes of Tiber or Uriel Septim is the real gut-punch. It suggests that "Evil" in your world isn't always an inherent choice, but a product of the "Poisoned Soil" (Ayleid culture). He was a man with a genius for order who was given a blueprint for tyranny.
	
	The Torment of the Efficient: For someone who values Absolute Order, watching the Interregnum, the Oblivion Crisis, and the current Civil War isn't just a spectacle—it's intellectual agony. He’s watched thousands of years of "mediocre" chaos undoing everything he spent his life perfecting.
	
	The Observer's Paradox: His Lichdom was meant to be his ultimate tool for eternal governance, but it became his eternal spectator's seat. He didn't just outlive his peers and, even if he considered them mediocre rivals, losing them also meant he lost his only context for existence; he ultimately outlived the very concept of the world he was built to rule.
	
	The Observer's Torment: To Ceyndu, the Septim Empire or the Aldmeri Dominion aren't just "new factions"; they are clumsy, loud attempts at the Order he already perfected and saw discarded. Following those acts, the Mede Empire wasn't just a political failure; it was a theological insult. If the Septims were "cack-handed" but had the divine legitimacy of the Dragonblood to at least attempt the architecture of a Wheel, the Medes were just warlords playing house in a palace they don't understand.
		- The Lack of Will: He likely views Titus Mede II not as a sovereign, but as a administrator of decay. A ruler who signs away his own subjects’ gods (The White-Gold Concordat) is the ultimate "mediocre variable" Ceyndu loathes. To a man who made his will the only reality, the Medes are just driftwood in the current of history.
		- The Messy Conquest: Conquest via the sword is "loud noise." It creates resentment, which creates chaos, which creates the need for more force. It’s a feedback loop of inefficiency. Ceyndu’s "Silence" was the antidote to this—a peace so absolute it didn't require an army to maintain it.
		- The Fractured Holdings: Watching Hammerfell walk away and the Thalmor rise was the ultimate "I told you so" for him. He sees a world that has forgotten how to be a Tower, settling instead for being a collection of huts.

XIX. The Ceyndu Prophecy: The Two Truths
	The "Mediocre Variable" Interpretation: In this view, Ceyndu’s arrogance was his final undoing. He wasn't waiting for a hero; he was just a prisoner waiting for a key "dense enough" to turn the lock. You aren't a chosen savior—you’re just the biggest "Metaphysical Shark" in a sea of medes, and your victory was the final act of a man who tricked you into giving him the Silence he craved.
    
	The "Perfected Sovereign" Interpretation: This aligns with the "Earned Godhood" philosophy. You are the "Rising Sun" who understands that Silence is the perfection of Order. You’ve taken Ceyndu's genius for efficiency (Choice C: Sovereign's Insight) but discarded the "Poisoned Soil" of Ayleid tyranny. You aren't just killing him; you’re vindicating the vision he was too "Ayleid" to achieve.
	
	Ceyndu ultimately acts as a narrative foil to the petty machinations of man and mer that define the 3rd and 4th Era. He was a being born in the wrong place at the wrong time. Without the cruelty of the Ayleids being carved into his very soul by mere circumstances of the culture he was born into he could've been a beacon of sanity, peace, order and an end to the cycle of chaos and war that has plagued the recent entries to the Elder Scrolls franchise. This reframes his death at the hands of the Dragonborn as a philosophical passing of the torch in the preferred interpretation; he's not simply committing suicide by hero. Instead he's passing the torch via a trial by combat; he's pushing himself to the absolute limits of his power to ensure that the one who inherits the blueprints to true stability and order is not only worthy, but strong enough to see it through.
	
XX. The Shadows of Bleaker’s Way: The Protege’s Venom
	Narrative Foundation: The Mentor’s Silence
		Pat’s Past: Pat, the current innkeeper of Bleaker’s Way, was once a "Man of Honor" within a den of thieves. He served as a legendary mentor, training a gifted Protege in the "Efficiency of the Blade" and the concepts of fraternity.
		The Abandonment: Seeking a "clean break" from his violent past, Pat retired to the remote village of Bleaker’s Way without a word of farewell. He intended this silence to be a gift of freedom for his Protege; instead, it was perceived as a soul-crushing betrayal.
		The Festering Hatred: Left without a master or a "final grade," the Protege’s admiration curdled into a venomous obsession. He became a tactical asset for Sethius, using Sethius's political reach to bypass Imperial patrol routes and act with impunity while he hunted for his retired mentor.

	The Catalyst: Stuhn’s Grace
		The Lure: The Protege orchestrated a series of robberies in Bleaker’s Way specifically to steal Stuhn’s Grace, Pat’s prized silver sword. The act was a "psychological summons," designed to force the retired "Man of Honor" out of hiding and into a final confrontation.
		The Irony: Pat, now a tired publican, had no idea who was responsible and simply hired the Dragonborn Emperor to recover his property. The Protege fished for a retired old man and caught a Metaphysical Shark.

	The Boss Encounter: The Wolf and the Grace
		Character Identity: The Protege is a master of spacing and resource suppression. He dual-wields the stolen Stuhn’s Grace (Extended Reach/Crit) and his own custom dagger, Wolfsbane (Stamina Drain).
		The Crisis of Confidence: Despite his skill, the Protege resorts to the "underhanded tactic" of his poisoned dagger because he still fears the ghost of Pat’s prime. He is a man who cannot forge his own legacy because he is still a prisoner of the one he was denied.
		Phase 2 Realization: Upon being pushed to his limit, the Protege realizes he isn't fighting Pat, but a "Dense-Souled" force of nature he is even less prepared for. The fight becomes a desperate, frantic attempt to validate his own existence before he is extinguished.

	The Triple-Branch Resolution
	Upon recovering the blade and ending the threat, Pat offers the player a choice that defines their "Renaissance" alignment:

		Choice A: The Mercenary’s Tax (Gold)
			The Narrative "Gray": Taking the gold from a village as broken as Bleaker’s Way is a "monstrous" act in line with Ceyndu’s critique. You’ve saved them, but you’ve left them as "huts in the dirt" with nothing left to trade for their future.
			The Technical: A standard GiveGold command.

		Choice B: The Passing of the Torch (Stuhn’s Grace)
			The Narrative: By taking the sword, you are officially becoming the Successor to Pat’s Honor. You are carrying the physical manifestation of his "Renaissance" past into the future of Cyrodiil.
			The Technical: Grants the unique Stuhn's Grace artifact. This is the "high-fidelity" choice for players who want to wield your custom asset.

		Choice C: The Sovereign’s Insight (Skill Buff)
			The Narrative: This is the "God-King" choice. You don't need his gold or his steel; you want his Will. By learning his "tricks," you are absorbing the Efficiency of Mastery that allowed him to train a monster like the Protégé.
			The Technical: A permanent ModSkill or custom Perk addition. This is the ultimate "Earned Godhood" reward—power that cannot be disarmed or sold.
			
XXI. The Protégé's Past
	Name: Caelan Ruarc
	
	History: Caelan Ruarc is a man who trained under the best swordsman in his organization but now seeks to surpass his master by any means necessary even if the methods are underhanded or dishonorable. The organization was not a typical place for a warrior such as his master as it was a guild of thieves and cutthroats but his master's skills with a blade and sense of honor made him unique and created a sense of admiration that led him to seek tutelage under this man. 

	He desires to prove himself as worthy of his master's legacy and as one who has surpassed him in cunning and skill. This desire has been warped by a sense of abandonment when his master retired from the organization before his training was complete eventually turning into something resembling animosity and hatred. This twisted feeling has led him to want to not only surpass his master but to supplant his master's legacy with one of his own. Methods used to achieve this are a means to an end and the ends justify the means in his eyes as his perspective is warped further and further from the ideals his master tried to instill by his internal conflict.
	
XXII. Pat's Introduction to the Quest
	[Player enters for the first time since RoC completion]

	Innkeeper: Hey there, welcome to the Goodwill Inn. Take a seat and I'll be right with ya!

	[Player takes a seat]

	Innkeeper: Now I know we've never been formally introduced but, as you might've noticed, we recently had a spot of trouble here in Bleaker's Way. I was wondering if you might be able to lend a hand?

	[Player responds with an affirmative nod]

	Innkeeper: Great! By the way, you can call me Pat. Everyone else does and, frankly, despite the many names I've  gone by over the years I'm rather fond of that one.

	Player: So what exactly happened here and how can I help?

	Pat: Straight to business, huh? Well we had been having a rash of bandit attacks in the general area. It was never anything too serious, someone would get robbed a few coins while on the road, but it was nothing the Watch couldn't handle.

	Player: So what changed?

	Pat: A while back, before you deposed Sethius, these attacks started to become far more frequent and grander in scale. I suspect someone came in, took control of the various small bandit groups in the area, and cut a deal with Sethius to avoid interference by the Watch.

	Player: Go on.

	Pat: I would've thought it'd die down once you took over but instead they got even bolder from the looks of it. The last bandit raid came quietly in the night, I barely had time to grab a weapon. By the time the Watch had arrived they'd made off with nearly all of the town's income from our farms and even stole my sword off the plaque by the fireplace. I was hoping you might be able to help get these things back.
	
XXIII. The Cohorts: The "Legion of the Spurned"
	Caelan doesn't travel alone. He has recruited others who feel "abandoned" by the systems of the world—people who see Pat's retirement as a luxury only the elite can afford.
		- Valerius "The Broken Shield": A former Imperial guard who was dishonorably discharged for refusing a corrupt order. He provides the "tank" role, using heavy armor to compensate for his lack of faith in the law.
		- Miri of the Whispers: A poisoner who was once a candidate for the Dark Brotherhood but was rejected for being "too personal" with her kills. She is the one who crafted Wolfsbane.
		Narrative Purpose: They serve as the "fraternity" that Pat tried to teach Caelan, but it’s a dark mirror of it—built on shared trauma and bitterness rather than honor.

XXIV. Expanded Dialogue: The Confrontation
	[The player enters initially unnoticed as Caelan has his back turned and is talking to his closest cohorts/confidants. They are all positioned around a rectangular table.]
	Caelan: He called it a furnace. Pat... he told me the heart has to burn cold to be fast. But I'm not cold, I'm burning alive! If I can't be his machine, I'll be his wreckage!
	Vane of the Black Drop: (A menacing chuckle) That's what I like about you Caelan, you don't hold back anything. It's why I trusted you with my finest creation.
	Silas the Bitter: (Gravelly, defensive) "I know the pain better than anyone, Caelan. Maybe even more than you. But this? This is a gamble. What if Pat doesn't show? What if we get a legion of guards instead of a tired old man? I know we can take 'em... but I'm too old to bleed for a ghost.
	Valerius: (Booming, arrogant) You can cower in the corner then while I do the heavy lifting, old man! More glory for the rest of us!
	Silas the Bitter: You better mind that tongue of yours, and quickly, before I carve it from your mouth!
	Valerius: HA! Bring it on old man!
	[Vane peers over the shoulder of Caelan and notices the player giving an affirmative nod as if he's acknowledging their presence and knows exactly who it is)
	Vane of the Black Drop: (Low, clinical) "Heh... as much as I'd love to see you two tear up a storm, I think we have a visitor. Be a bit... ingracious of us to keep them waiting, wouldn't it?" (The cackle should feel dry, like old parchment rubbing together)
	[Caelan turns to face you]
	Caelan: Huh, look at you. Pat sent a king to do a commoner's work. Did he tell you about me? Did he tell you about the 'Man of Honor' who walked away from the only person who actually believed in his lies?
	Player (The God-King): He didn't mention you. He just wants his sword back.
	Caelan: [Laughs bitterly] Of course. I'm just a footnote in a retired man's ledger. He calls himself "Pat" now? A name for a peasant, a name for someone who wants to blend into the dirt. I took Stuhn’s Grace because it didn't belong over a fireplace. It belongs in the hand of someone who isn't afraid to bleed for his legacy! Still, I somehow doubt your claim. After all Pat didn't just choose me; he recognized me! He saw the furnace in me before I even knew it was there. You think you're different because you wear a crown? You're just the next man in line to find out that "Honor" is just a word we use to dress up the butcher's work! Pray to whatever gods you worship because this is where your story ends!
	
XXV. Phase 2: The "Dense-Soul" Shift
	As the fight progresses and the player's Wildcat injuries or Valhalla parries start to dismantle him, Caelan’s dialogue shifts from bravado to existential terror.
		Caelan (at 50% Health): "Wait... your movements... you're not just fast. You're heavy. The air around you—it’s like you’re crushing the very wind."
		Caelan (at 25% Health - resorting to Wolfsbane): "I was supposed to kill a ghost! I wasn't prepared to fight a God! If my master won't judge me, then let the Void take us both!"

XXVI. Refinement on the Three-Branch Resolution
	Pat (Upon choosing Choice C):
		You don't want the gold, and you don't want the steel. You've got that look in your eye... the same one I saw in the mirror decades ago, before I got tired. You want the 'How.' You want to know the shortest distance between two hearts with a blade. Fine. I'll show you the efficiency that Caelan was too blinded by hate to see. Now before we begin I just want to say I sent you thinking you'd give 'em a fair fight. I see now I was wrong. You didn't just win; you erased them. So I want you to remember: once you know how to break a man this easily, you can never go back to being just an ordinary man. 
		
		You lose something of yourself in the knowing, ya'know? When you can so easily sever a mans head from their neck and do it without feeling a thing, something in you just dies. It turns the heart from a place of warmth into the cold unfeeling furnace of a machine built only to kill. Make sure you don't fall into that trap; I don't want to see another life end in tragedy like theirs did.
		
XXVII. The Combat Barks of a Band of Misfits
	Silas the Bitter (The Cynic):
		- Another one for the dirt... I've seen this dance too many times.
		- Look at you, all decked out in finery and power. Pat must be truly desperate if he's paying a 'Hero' to do a commoner's butcher-work. You're just a big fish in a very small pond, 'Your Majesty.' Let's see how you handle the open sea.
	
	Valerius (The Ego):
		- I'll break that crown over your head!
		- Leave this one to me, Caelan! I'll grind them into dust!
		
	Vane of the Black Drop (The Clinical):
		- (When a poison hit lands) There... feel the "furnace" slowing? That's the Wolfsbane poison doing Pat's work for him.
		- Careful now... your blood is becoming so very... heavy. Would be a shame to see it splattered all over the walls.
	
	Caelan Ruarc (The Wreckage):
		- I'm the one who stayed! I'm the one who earned the Grace!
		- I'll carve my name into history! I refuse to be another footnote!
