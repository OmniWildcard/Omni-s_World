The focus is heavy on improving immersion and merging modern combat systems with Skyrim\u0027s vanilla combat via the BFCO combat system; all-the-while striking a decent balance between realism and game-like convenience. Race against the clock to try and defeat Alduin and Harkon within 100 days or perish with the rest of the world as the apocalypse comes to fruition!",
